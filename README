This service was created by me to copy data from an old active SolidDB database into a more usable MSSQL database and keep up with daily deltas.
It was made because some of my 64 bit tools could not properly interact with the SolidDB databse.

You need to create a config file for the program to function called config.conf and point to it in Service1.cs line 25

It needs to be formatted like so:
SolidDSN=mysoliddns
SolidUID=mysoliduid
SolidPWD=mysolidpwd
MSSQLServer=myserver
MSSQLUid=mymssqluid
MSSQLPwd=mymssqlpwd
MSSQLDatabase=mymssqldatabase

Then recompile the program and you should be good to go!
